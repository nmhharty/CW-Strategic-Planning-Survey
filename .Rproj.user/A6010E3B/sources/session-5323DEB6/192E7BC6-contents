# Background

A Google Form survey was sent to all Colorado Whitewater Board Members in July 2022 to inform strategic planning for the organization. Board members were asked to rank the areas of Events, Kids Team, Instruction, Safety, Infrastructure, Access/Conservation, and Other in order of priority with **1 being highest priority** and **7 being lowest priority**. Unfortunately, respondents were able to select the same priority rank for multiple areas. The intent was to force one ranking per area.

# Results

A total of `r nrow(raw)` anonymous responses were received (65% response rate).

The following chart shows the mean ranking for each category, with the highest to lowest priority from left to right. **Lower number indicates higher priority**. Below the chart is a table summarizing the same information.

```{r PriorityRankingGraphSummary}
raw_numeric |>
  select(16,2:8) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:8, names_to = "Category", values_to = "Rank") |>
  mutate(Category = str_sub(Category, 1,-5)) |>
  group_by(Category) |>
  summarise("Mean Ranking" = round(mean(Rank, na.rm = TRUE),2)) |>
  mutate(Rescaled = (7/`Mean Ranking`)) |>
plot_ly(x = ~Category,
        y = ~`Mean Ranking`,
        marker = list(color = c("#3d6ddb", "#3d6ddb", "#3d6ddb", "#5bab49", "#3d6ddb", "#3d6ddb", "#5bab49"))) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(categoryorder = "total ascending"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Mean Ranking"))
```

```{r PriorityRankingTableSummary}
raw_numeric |>
  select(16,2:8) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:8, names_to = "Category", values_to = "Rank") |>
  mutate(Category = str_sub(Category, 1,-5)) |>
  group_by(Category) |>
  summarise("Mean Ranking" = round(mean(Rank, na.rm = TRUE),2), "Min Ranking" = min(Rank, na.rm = TRUE), "Max Ranking" = max(Rank, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(`Mean Ranking`) |>
  kable(caption = "Ranking of Where to Invest Resources") |>
  kable_paper(full_width = F, "hover") |>
  row_spec(1:2, bold = T, background = "#dbce3d") |>
  footnote("The smaller the ranking, the greater the priority. Table is ordered from highest priority to lowest priority.")

```

**Key Takeaways**:

-   Instruction and Safety have consensus as the highest priority areas to invest resources, followed by Events.\
-   All categories except Kids Team and Other were selected by at least one respondent as the highest priority.\
-   There is a wide range of opinions about the priority of other categories.

Below is a summary of the ideas shared by board members as to how to invest resources. This summary includes the top themes, but all ideas should be reviewed. After this summary are tables with the themes from each category, ordered by most to least common. The [appendix](#appendix) includes the full responses to these questions for additional details.
